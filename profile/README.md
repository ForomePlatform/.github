# Forome Platform

## Forome Association

We are a team of data management experts and bioinformaticians,
who founded the Forome Open Genomics community to
accelerate Mendelian diseases diagnostic.

## AnFiSA

AnFiSA is an open-source computational platform for the analysis
of sequencing data for rare genetic disease

We have created a fully open-source variant curation tool, AnFiSA, with the
intention to invite and accept contributions from clinicians, researchers, and
professional software developers. The design of AnFiSA addresses the
aforementioned issues via the following architectural principles: using a
multidimensional database management system (DBMS) for genomic data to address
reproducibility, curated decision trees adaptable to changing clinical rules,
and a crowdsourcing-friendly interface to address difficult-to-diagnose cases.
We discuss how we have chosen our technology stack and describe the design and
implementation of the software. Finally, we show in detail how selected
workflows can be implemented using the current version of AnFiSA by a medical
geneticist.

## Start using AnFiSA

[Deploy repository](https://github.com/ForomePlatform/deploy)
is your starting point to start using AnFiSA. The easiest 
way to deploy is to 
[use docker-compose](https://github.com/ForomePlatform/deploy/blob/main/docker-compose/README.md).

To set up development environment, use local deploy.
